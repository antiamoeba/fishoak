# Fishing the Westport Jetty

Located just a 2.5 hr drive from Seattle proper, the Westport Jetty is an absolute fishing gem. It's probably the best place I've fished for consistently catching rockfish, lingcod, greenling and crab --- as long as you're willing to brave the jagged jetty rocks.

## About the Westport Jetty

Close to shore, fishing off the jetty provides some easy access to the surf, without the need to get wet like fishing off a beach. Fishermen make good catches of perch here using shrimp or sandworms.

Towards the middle of the jetty near the jetty horn, the rock fishing starts to pick up. Fishing the harbor side can yield excellent catches of predominantly black rockfish with a sprinkling of other rockfish. Throwing swimbaits on a Texas rig/jighead, or fishing bait under a drift bobber works quite consistently if the fish are around. I've found that getting the timing right here is really important --- it is really important to fish the slack tide here, as the current in the harbor can absolutely rip, killing the bite. The fishing can also be somewhat better in the morning than the afternoon. If the conditions are right, you'll be rock hopping back to your car with a limit of rockfish in your backpack. With a long enough cast here, a crab snare can also provide a tasty Dungeness for dinner.

If you instead fish the ocean side of the jetty, you'll soon find that the greenling are absolutely everywhere. It can be impossible to keep the greenling off your hook if you use shrimp for bait. These greenling can be absolutely massive too --- my personal record here is a gauge-busting 20 inch greenling. There are also big lingcod here --- the local trick is to rig a small live greenling for bait weightless, which I can attest works incredibly well. I've also caught a number of striped surfperch and cabezon here, but never a rockfish --- guess they like hanging out more on the harbor side.

At the very end of the jetty is where the sea birds make their home. The rocks here are painted white with poop, and it smells like Satan himself dropped a load here --- but, this also means less fishing pressure. What that means is big lingcod, and good fishing.

Supposedly when in season, fishing a cut-plug herring under a bobber can yield salmon, but I've never tried myself.

## Notes

The jetty can get quite crowded here, especially on the harbor side. Be ready for fishermen casting over your shoulder.
