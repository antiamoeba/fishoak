# Fishing and Hiking Heather Lake

Heather Lake is a nice hike just an hour from Redmond. A few switchbacks up a shady, forested hillside takes you up to a beautiful lake with what seems to be mediocre fishing.

## About the Hike

Like nearby <a href="/lake22">Lake 22</a>, the trail works its way up a few switchbacks until it comes up to the lake. However, you'll be in the forest the entire time, so at some point you might question your sanity as the trees and the twists and turns start blurring together.

However, you'll eventually hit Heather Lake, where you'll get a stunning view of a lake with a beautiful mountain backdrop. It'll make it all worth it.

The trail is muddy and degraded at many points, and you'll have to walk through a few small streams. I would recommend wearing a pair of hiking boots. As a result, I'd probably rate this hike as an easy-to-moderate, perhaps leaning more on the moderate side.

## About the Fishing

This lake seems really shallow. I walked around the entirety of the lake, and most of the lake seems about a foot deep - at least the areas you can cast to. At the very back of the lake, there is a slight boulder field where the water seems to get a bit deeper, but I had no luck here over quite a few casts - I didn't see a single fish follow, and there was little insect life in the water. This gives me the suspicion that the fishing here isn't quite so great. There might be some bigger fish towards the center of the lake, but it's not easy to get to...

There's also a little lagoon that seems like it should be deep enough to hold fish, on the left side of the lake. But this one seemed pretty lifeless when I fished it too.

## Notes

If you had a float tube of some kind, it might be helpful for getting towards the deeper water.
