# Fishing and Hiking Lake 22

Next door neighbors to <a href="/heatherlake">Heather Lake,</a> Lake 22 is a roughly 5.4 mile hike that is a quick drive from Redmond. Hidden waterfalls line a trail that lead to a sprawling vista of a shallow lake before a stunning mountain backdrop. It took us about 4 hours for the hiking itself, and we spent about an hour at the lake.

## About the Hike

For the most part, the trail meanders through a brushy forest where you'll get views of a few waterfalls through the trees. Most of these waterfalls would be pretty impressive I think if there were less overgrown branches... Some of the trail is pretty wet and many of the steps are somewhat degraded, so I'd recommend bringing a sturdy pair of hiking boots.

At some point in the hike, you'll hit a boulder field, where the lack of shade is a blessing in disguise --- behind you, you'll see a nice view of a few mountains in the distance. The rocks here can be a little tricky to walk on, and can take some hopping around.

Eventually, you'll return to the forest, where a quick saunter will take you to Lake 22. There are a couple of small waterfalls that frame the back of the lake.

In general, there is a fair amount of elevation gain, but the hike is pretty short so I'd rate it as an easy to intermediate hike. I saw a couple of kids make it up, so it might be family friendly to a degree.


## About the Fishing

The lake here is a bit deeper than nearby Heather Lake, but not that much deeper. There's a few deeper spots at the end of the lake by a boulder field that might be worth concentrating energy in.

While I was here, I saw many trout jumping. However, they were all far beyond casting distance at the lake --- I could not get an 1/8 oz Kastmaster anywhere close. Given the depth of this lake and where these fish were feeding, it seems like a float tube could be really useful.

## Notes

Parking at the trailhead requires an annual <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r6/passes-permits/recreation/?cid=fsbdev2_027010">Northwest Forest Pass</a> or a <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r6/passes-permits/recreation/?cid=fsbdev2_027009">Forest Day Pass</a>.
