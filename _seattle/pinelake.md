# Fishing Pine Lake

Located in Sammamish just 20 minutes from Redmond, Pine Lake is a nice spot for a quick trip to get your fishing fix in. It is surrounded by conifers and like many other Seattle lakes, encircled by private property.

## About the Lake

The only real public fishing spot here is a fairly large dock, which can get crowded at times. It provides a decent access point to deep water --- with a good cast, you can pretty easily access 20 count water depth. Casting Powerbait or Micetails towards this deeper water typically yields good results after a trout plant. The regulars have mentioned that very long leaders (5 ft) are important here for catching fish, but I've so far been able to catch fish with with my normal 2-3 ft leaders.

I've also noticed casting off the sides of the dock, e.g., horizontally to shore, can also do fairly well. I've had pretty good success here using a minijig. Seems like people also do ok flicking spoons.

If you want to fish from shore, you're probably out of luck. There are really only two spots that you can cast from the shore, and about 30 feet off the shore there is a substantial weedline, so good luck reeling in a fish.


## Notes

Seems like a boat would be really helpful here, but I'm a shoreline angler.
