# Fishing Beaver Lake

Beaver Lake is next door neighbors with Pine Lake, about 20 minutes from Redmond. Surrounded by conifers, it has a primitive boat launch and a bit of public shoreline access at Beaver Lake Lodge.

## About the Lake

There's only a little bit of shoreline access here into Beaver Lake - there's probably about 4 real spots that you can fish from.

The first spot is the beach area, by the covered pavilion. Most of the water here seems pretty shallow --- I didn't catch anything here, but I suspect soon after a trout plant it might not be a bad place to drop a line. To the left of the beach there's a picnic table that seems to be a popular spot to fish, but I didn't get a chance to try it.

To the right of the beach, there's a little shallow cove. I saw a bass swimming around when I visited, but I wasn't able to hook it. Probably will be a decent amount of panfish and perch in the summer, since there's a lot of overhanging trees and plants that provide plenty of cover.

This brings to our final two spots, at the very eastern side of the park. One spot sits out onto a point with a picnic table, while the other spot allows you to cast into a small lake arm. Both spots give access to fair water depth - I was able to count to about 11 when throwing my baits. I caught a couple trout here on Powerbait, casting as far out as I could. I threw around some Kastmasters and minijigs for some time without much success.

There are a lot of overhanging trees and plants here, so be careful on your casts.

## Notes

Seems like a boat would be really helpful here like Pine Lake, but unfortunately I was only able to fish from shore when I visited.
