    <h4>Big Hammer Swimbait</h4>
    <div>If you don't want to use bait, this is a good all-around swimbait for rocky-shore species. I usually fish it on a jighead, or on a dropshot rig (basically a high-low rig). Try and fish the lure as close to the bottom as possible (unless you're fishing for black or blue rockfish). Brand doesn't matter a huge amount here, but some people swear by <a href="https://amzn.to/3cscPjo">Keitechs</a>, which I have not tried myself.</div>

When fishing the rocks, there is always a surprising amount of current, so you'll need some heavy weights. I usually use anywhere from half an ounce to four ounces for my rigs. You'll also snag and break off a lot, so make sure to bring a lot of spares. I've listed the weights I use below, in order of preference.

    <h4>Cloth Bags</h4>
    <div>Every time I snag off and leave a hunk of metal at the bottom of the ocean, I always feel kinda bad. As a result, I recently switched to using cloth bags, which I fill with gravel and small rocks at the fishing spot and hopefully biodegrade in the ocean. I've found that these cloth bags work incredibly well. They snag much less frequently than the metal weights I used to use, and the fish don't seem to mind. In addition, they are much cheaper.</div>

    <h4>Ultra Steel Bullet Weights, 3/4 ounce</h4>
    <div>I usually use steel weights whenever I can. While they tend to be somewhat more expensive than lead-based weights, they lack most of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead#Toxicity">toxicity and developmental impacts of lead</a>. In regards to your own health, you should use steel weights whenever possible. However, steel weights can be hard to find in larger sizes.</div>

    <h4>Lead Sinkers, 2 ounces</h4>
    <div>These lead weights are much cheaper than steel, and come in much larger sizes. However, keep in mind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead#Toxicity">toxicity and developmental impacts of lead</a>. Use at your own risk.</div>
