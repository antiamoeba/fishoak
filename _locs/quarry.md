# Fishing Quarry Lakes

In Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area, there are two lakes you can fish - Horseshoe and Rainbow Lake. Horseshoe Lake gets regularly stocked by the [EBPRD](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/fishing/anglers-edge-online) as well as the [DFW](https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FishPlants/Default.aspx?water=Horseshoe+Lake&time=All). All this means a lot of planter trout (and some catfish), as well as lot of fishing pressure. There are also some resident bass, catfish, and other warmwater fish in both Horseshoe and Rainbow.


## About the Lake

The main attraction here is the trout fishing at Horseshoe Lake. All of the lakes here used to be part of a gravel quarry, which means that the water is quite deep close to shore. As a result, it seems like a lot of different spots on the lake are good for the trout. In general, it pays to keep moving here - oftentimes certain parts of the lake will be pumping out fish, while other regions are totally lifeless.

Perhaps the area that sees the most pressure is the small cove with the fishing dock to the left of the boat ramp - fishermen are often shoulder-to-shoulder here. Often the fish are planted by the boat ramp, and as a result this cove can be a hot spot for people sight-fishing for the freshly planted trout. Small mini jigs, Kastmasters, and other lures are the most successful.

Another popular spot is the so-called "Fisherman's Row" - a stretch of easily-accessible water to the right of the boat ramp. Here, the water is mostly shallow close to shore, but a steep dropoff is accessible with a nice cast. Powerbait, nightcrawlers, and salmon eggs seem to do the trick here.

A somewhat less popular spot is the area around the fish tube. The water here is quite deep, and the shoreline can be steep and hard to access. Powerbait, mini jigs, and Kastmasters do well here. However, expect big crowds if the trout are being stocked at the fish tube.

Most other spots on the lake get much less pressure. Some fishermen swear by certain spots on the backside of the lake. It does seem like there are many brush piles and shallow stretches on the backside, so pick your spot wisely if you do intend to avoid the crowds.

During the summer, the EBPRD occasionally stocks channel catfish in Horseshoe. Nightcrawlers, cut bait, shrimp, stinkbaits, and other classic catfish baits do the job.

On the bass in Horseshoe - I've never tried myself. However, most of the lake bottom seems to be fairly featureless, so I suspect you might have to stick with spinnerbaits, crankbaits, and other lures that let you cover a large amount of water. I've heard there are big bass (largemouth and smallmouth) in here, so it might be worth a shot.

On Rainbow Lake - I haven't fished it much. But I assume classic bass and catfish tactics should do just fine.

## Notes

The EBPRD charges both a $5 parking fee, as well as a $5 fishing fee. Expensive, but can be worth it if you can find the fish - which are often big.

Lead weights are not allowed here - so make sure to grab some steel or tin weights - I often use the [Ultra Steel](https://amzn.to/3eqPm1O) or [Gremlin Green](https://amzn.to/3yVxtSo) brands.
