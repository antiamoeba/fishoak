# Fishing Boronda Lake

In Foothills Park, Boronda Lake is a slightly more developed version of [Arastradero Lake](/arastradero) in the hills of Palo Alto. Until recently, the lake was off-limits to non-Palo Alto residents.

## About the Lake

The lake is quite pretty - it sits in front of a beautiful forested hill, and is surrounded by tules, meadows, and a few rocky outcroppings. Unfortunately, the fishing doesn't quite match the views.

Boronda Lake is extremely shallow, and the bottom is effectively covered with thick mats of vegetation. Around the boat docks and boat ramp the water gets a smidge deeper, as well as towards the center of the lake, but these deeper areas are few and far between. What that means is that the populations of larger fish tend to be quite small.

Thanks to the weeds, the bluegill fishing can be quite good. The area near the island and in the shade under the few docks around the lake tend to be hot spots. Nightcrawlers should work quite well.

The bass can be somewhat harder to catch. I would stick to weedless setups to avoid instantly catching the weeds that carpet the bottom of the lake. If you want to catch bass, I'd probably look elsewhere in the South Bay.


## Notes

The area near the lake has been extremely busy recently, thanks to the public opening of Foothills Park. It may be difficult to find parking, and the park may close during periods of the day as a result - check the official website for up-to-date details.
