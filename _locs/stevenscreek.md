To be honest, Stevens Creek Reservoir is not a great place to fish. Surrounded by tree-covered hills, it is a pretty place to be, and can be a nice area to take a walk. But the fishing is pretty terrible.


## About the Lake

Stevens Creek has a pretty hefty case of the bathtub rings - it's a big victim of water drawdowns every year. The shoreline access is very steep, so make sure to wear good shoes. It also means that there's very little fish habitat - there's not many weeds or logs or fallen trees in the water. What that means is that there aren't many fish in the first place, and the few fish that swim in the lake are hard to find.

The DFG used to stock this lake with trout, but no more. Nowadays most people fish for the few resident bass. Try the shady areas around the lake, on the dam, or whatever structure you can find. People do okay with dropshots. The evening topwater bite is also decent.

People also catch a decent amount of carp here. There are also a few bluegill here and there, but you need to hunt them down.

## Notes

There are quite a few poison oak stands around Stevens Creek, be careful.

There's also a shooting range across the street. The noise can be very annoying when you're just trying to have a quiet fishing trip.

If you want to avoid paying the parking fee, just park along the road just outside the lot. Or just don't pay the fee and park inside - many people I've seen do that (at your own risk, of course).
