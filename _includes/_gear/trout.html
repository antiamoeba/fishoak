        <h4>Powerbait Micetails</h4>
        <div>A piece of soft plastic infused with Powerbait flavoring. These days, I far prefer micetails over Powerbait, 
            as I think they have a bit of extra attraction in moving water. Additionally, micetails are way less messy than the Powerbait,
            and you don't leave random floating pieces of plastic dough floating in the lake after you're done fishing.

        <h4>Mini jig, 1/16 or 1/32 oz</h4>
        <div>A small tube that can be twitched in the water to entice wary trout. Keep your rod tip high, and wiggle the
            lure in the middle of the water column. Can be very effective, especially if you can see the fish. Can be
            hard to cast far, unless you're using very light line (2 - 4 lb)</div>

        <h4>Acme Kastmaster, 1/8 oz</h4>
        <div>One of my favorite lures for trout fishing, very useful for covering a lot of water and finding where the
            active fish are. It's a very aerodynamic lure that can be casted quite far on light line. I've had the most
            success on stop-and-go, erratic retrieves. Use gold Kastmasters on sunny days or in murky water. Use silver
            Kastmasters on cloudy days or clear water. Kastmasters can be somewhat expensive - South Bend also sells <a
                href="https://amzn.to/39CXJpH">Kastaways</a> which are somewhat cheaper but can't say I've personally
            used them.</div>

        <h4>Panther Martin, 1/16 oz</h4>
        <div>A classic trout spinner. I like a retrieve with many erratic jerks with these spinners, to let the blade
            flutter as much as possible. Traditionally the gold blade with black body and yellow spots has been the most
            effective for me, but the other colors should also work.</div>

        <h4>Powerbait</h4>
        <div>The classic trout bait. I typically use micetails in favor of Powerbait these days, but sometimes the original dough
            will work when nothing else will. Take a small bit of the dough, and mold it around a size 14-16 treble hook on a
            sliding sinker rig. Cast the bait out and just let it sit. It can smell kinda bad, so be ready to vigorously
            clean your hands afterward. I've linked the garlic flavor, but the corn and original scents work just as
            well. I personally don't think the color matters a whole lot, but some people swear by chartreuse.</div>

        <h4>Thomas Buoyant, 1/4 or 1/6 oz</h4>
        <div>A Kastmaster alternative. It casts a somewhat smaller distance, but the spoon has a slightly different
            fluttering action that seems to sometimes entice more hits.</div>
