        <h4>Berkley Gulp Sandworms</h4>
        <div>Dealing with squid or shrimp for bait can be a pain, with lugging around a cooler to keep it fresh, the
            bait falling off the hook, and potentially even running out. As a result, I like keeping a pack of these
            flavor-infused plastic sandworms in my tackle box just in case. They seem to work ok for rockfish, although
            not as good as the fresh stuff. These worms are also one of the best baits for catching surfperch off
            beaches on the West Coast.</div>

        <h4>Berkley Bonefish Ribbed Swimbait</h4>
        <div>If you don't want to use bait, this is a good all-around swimbait for rocky-shore species. I usually fish it on a Texas rig or jighead, or occasionally a dropshot rig. Try and fish the lure as close to the bottom as possible (unless you're fishing for black or blue rockfish).</div>

        <h4>Keitech Swimbait</h4>
        <div>The swimbait that most people swear by. I honestly have had better personal success recently with the <a href="https://amzn.to/4iPcAPs">Berkley swimbait</a>, but people have had some awesome catches on these Keitechs.</div>

When fishing the rocks, there is always a surprising amount of current, so you'll need some heavy weights. I usually use
anywhere from half an ounce to four ounces for my rigs. You'll also snag and break off a lot, so make sure to bring a
lot of spares. I've listed the weights I use below, in order of preference.

        <h4>Cloth Bags</h4>
        <div>I hate snagging off and leaving a hunk of metal at the bottom of the ocean. As a
            result, I recently switched to using cloth bags, which I fill with gravel and small rocks at the fishing
            spot and hopefully biodegrade in the water. I've found that these cloth bags work incredibly well. They snag
            much less frequently than the metal weights I used to use, and the fish don't seem to mind. In addition,
            they are much cheaper.</div>

        <h4>Ultra Steel Bullet Weights, 3/4 ounce</h4>
        <div>I usually use steel weights whenever I can. While they tend to be somewhat more expensive than lead-based
            weights, they lack most of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead#Toxicity">toxicity and
                developmental impacts of lead</a>. In regards to your own health, you should use steel weights whenever
            possible. However, steel weights can be hard to find in larger sizes.</div>

        <h4>Lead Sinkers, 2 ounces</h4>
        <div>These lead weights are much cheaper than steel, and come in much larger sizes. However, keep in mind the <a
