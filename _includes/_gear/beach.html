My baits of choice for the perch (fish on a high-low rig or fish-finder aka Carolina rig):

        <h4>Raw shrimp</h4>
        <div>The jack-of-all-trades bait for our local saltwater fish. Works for rockfish, cabezon, lingcod, surfperch, jacksmelt, croaker, and many more. It can be a bit hard to keep on your hook --- switching to cooked from raw shrimp can help with that problem, with IMO slightly decreased bite rate. </div>

        <h4>Berkley Gulp Sandworms</h4>
        <div>These fake worms are one of the best baits for catching surfperch off
            beaches on the West Coast --- for whatever reason, they really love these scented pieces of plastic. They also stay on the hook a lot better than shrimp, so you can really bomb them out past the breakers.</div>

        <h4>Cloth Bags</h4>
        <div>I hate snagging off and leaving a hunk of metal at the bottom of the ocean. As a
            result, I recently switched to using cloth bags, which I fill with gravel and small rocks at the fishing
            spot and hopefully biodegrade in the water. I've found that these cloth bags work incredibly well. They snag
            much less frequently than the metal weights I used to use, and the fish don't seem to mind. In addition,
            they are much cheaper.</div>

        <h4>Ultra Steel Bullet Weights, 3/4 ounce</h4>
        <div>I usually use steel weights whenever I can. While they tend to be somewhat more expensive than lead-based
            weights, they lack most of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead#Toxicity">toxicity and
                developmental impacts of lead</a>. In regards to your own health, you should use steel weights whenever
            possible. However, steel weights can be hard to find in larger sizes.</div>

        <div>These lead weights are much cheaper than steel, and come in much larger sizes. However, keep in mind the <a
