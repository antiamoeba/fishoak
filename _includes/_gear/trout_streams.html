        <h4>Powerbait Micetails</h4>
        <div>A piece of soft plastic infused with Powerbait flavoring. Cast them into the current with a small split shot and let them drift
            with the current. I will use micetails interchangeably with nightcrawlers, but sometimes these seem to entice more hits.

        <h4>Panther Martin, 1/16 oz</h4>
        <div>A classic trout spinner. Cast them upstream, and pop it off the bottom to let the blade
            flutter as much as possible. Traditionally the gold blade with black body and yellow spots has been the most
            effective for me, but the other colors should also work.</div>

        <h4>Nymph collection</h4>
        <div>One of my favorite ways to target trout that sometimes seems to work a lot better than bait/lures. Gently lob them out and let it drift with the current.
             If you don't have a fly rod, a spinning rod with a small split shot or casting bubble works as well.</div>
