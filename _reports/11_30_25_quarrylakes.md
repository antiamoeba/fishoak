Last week I caught a limit of trout at Horseshoe, so I decided to pop by today to see if I could replicate my success. I wanted to experiment a bit with some new spots --- before, I had a bunch of "secret" fishing holes that I could reliably catch a few trout at without a soul in sight, but nowadays seems like other people have found them. Overall, the action was fairly slow --- I tried about 5 different locations on the backside, without much luck at 4 of them.

At the last spot, I ended up nabbing a DFG on a <a href="https://amzn.to/3MblFGg">Gulp bubblegum trout worm</a>. It was a little small for my taste and I didn't want to bother cleaning it, so I threw it back to live another day.

Unfortunately, that wasn't the end of the story. I was starting to pack up my gear as it was getting dark, when I heard a tumble of rocks behind me. I spun around just in time to see my rod and rod holder go into the drink, dragged away by some Quarry monster that was enticed enough by my <a href="https://amzn.to/48IgXbQ">salmon egg</a> to yank my rod holder out of the ground. There goes my $100 setup...
