Went out with a friend to Quarry Lakes today, and fished a couple spots all around the lake. For the most part seems like lures weren't producing, but we did ok on micetails --- we managed 7 trout between the two of us (3 lassens, 4 DFGs), and we lost 3 more. All of the fish were on <a href="https://amzn.to/4gRkgPn">chartreuse and orange micetails</a>, casted out as far as we could. As always, Quarry was pretty location dependent --- had to find a spot with fish.

The lake was pretty busy, and I imagine more people will be coming in with the holiday. Hope they plant a lot of trout!
