I had nothing to do last week so I went to the pet store to buy a tub of worms, and since then I've been itching to deploy them! Since I had the day off today, I decided to go trout fishing at Sandy Wool to try to put the worms to use --- but I stupidly left the carton at home, so I had to make do with what was in my tacklebox. In general, seems like action was pretty slow, although I did see a number of trout swim by with serious cases of lockjaw. I did end up nabbing a decent DFG that hit my marshmallow + <a href="https://amzn.to/48IgXbQ">salmon egg</a> right on the drop. Doesn't seem like anyone else caught fish besides me and the guy next to me, who got 3 trout from the same school I caught my trout from.

I was able to get a couple follows on my Z-Man <a href="https://amzn.to/4qxcm2k">Shad Fryz</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/4jnAKRC">Stingerz</a>, but no takers. They seem to have a very subtle action that the more finicky trout like, although I think they might be a little too subdued to entice a proper bite.
