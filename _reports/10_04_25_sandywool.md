The ocean was a bit rough today, so I decided to take a bit of a late start and head somewhere a bit closer to home. It's always nice spending a sunny afternoon at Sandy Wool, where the paragliders, dogs, and many hikers provide a welcome backdrop to the sometimes slow fishing.

Today, I primarily fished a couple spots on the western side of the lake, as the eastern side can be pretty shadeless. I managed to snag a solid catfish with a piece of shrimp, tossed as far as I could into the depths of the pond. Both my friend and I got a couple other solid bites on shrimp as well but could not convert the fish. No action on the salted mackerel, or a wacky-rigged <a href="https://amzn.to/3VSa6FB" target="_blank">Z-Man Zinkerz</a>.

I saw a couple of other people fishing for bass, but did not seem like anyone got any bites. Some people took home a couple of bullfrogs. Definitely more fishermen than I expected for summertime Sandy Wool.
