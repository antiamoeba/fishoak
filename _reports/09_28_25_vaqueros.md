Been meaning to try and catch some catfish recently. This weekend I saw that the weather report called for balmy weather inland, so I decided to take the opportunity to head to the normally extremely hot Los Vaqueros Reservoir.

There were a lot more people than I expected. I don't normally head out this direction in the summer, but it seemed like there were almost more people than trout season. As a result, it was tough going trying to find a good spot. My friend and I ended up having to hike to the other side of Cowboy Cove to get to a spot with decent access to deeper water.

In general, the catfishing was fairly slow, although we saw a fair number of what looked like stripers feeding on the surface as well as  a couple bass cruising the shallows. I did end up managing a very nice catfish on a piece of salted mackerel, that was nearly the size of my net.

There were a lot of cows roaming the lake today. Seems like they live a good life feasting on the grass that grows by the lakeshore.
