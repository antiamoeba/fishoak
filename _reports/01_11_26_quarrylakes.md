Quarry Lakes finally has some decent fishing (although spot dependent as usual)! I fished the backside this time. I started with a jig for a couple minutes without any takers, before finally switching to a marshmallow and nightcrawler. The guys next to me limited out before I caught a fish, but once I left I was able to nab 3 small DFGs. They all swallowed the hook so they ended up coming home with me. I also broke off my leader on a nice Lassen by shore, as well as some other mystery fish I was not able to lay eyes upon --- guess I need to be a bit more vigilant on changing out my leader.

My friend got three solid bites on <a href="https://amzn.to/4gRkgPn">chartreuse and orange micetails</a>, but he wasn't able to set the hook on them. Guess that means there should still be some fish left in the lake!

Reporter's note: I'm pleasantly surprised how the marshmallow and worm turned out --- clearly I was catching fish. Usually, when I fish worms, I use a <a href="https://amzn.to/39yXBHw">worm blower</a> to make sure they float. Turns out the marshmallow floats the entire setup really well, without needing to do any worm surgery with the blower. The con is that the marshmallow can fly off the hook when you cast, but in my experience it's not too much worse than standard dough Powerbait.
