title: Relaxing afternoon at Bean Hollow
date: 2026-1-17

The waves were calm today and there was a decent low tide in the afternoon (0.5), so I decided to take the opportunity to hit up Bean Hollow State Beach again. I was feeling lazy so I mainly stuck with bait --- today the name of the game was squid. I ended up landing a baby cabezon, a pan-sized black rockfish and a decent black-and-yellow rockfish. Fairly decent catches given how many fish I usually catch these days from the San Mateo coastline...

As we were leaving at sunset, we ran into a ranger who checked our licenses and catches. He mentioned that everyone else he had checked that day had not done as well as us. A nice ego booster :)
