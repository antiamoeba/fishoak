Lately, Iâ€™ve been trying to move away from using Powerbait because I dislike the environmental impact of dough falling off hooks and littering the shoreline. As a result, I've been meaning to switch to salmon eggs instead, though I've always wondered how they compare to Powerbait in terms of effectiveness. Today, I decided to make the drive out to Shadow Cliffs to put them to the test. I rigged a <a href="https://amzn.to/4gRkgPn">white and orange micetail</a> on one rod, while on my second rod I hooked up a single <a href="https://amzn.to/3BJY0YL">orange salmon egg</a> with a mini marshmallow.

I started off by fishing the Stanley Blvd shoreline. Gently tossing out my salmon egg about 30 ft netted me a small Lassen and a tiny DFG, while I didn't get a single hit on my micetail rod.

However, the water was pretty disgusting there, as there was a lot of littered Powerbait covering the shoreline as well as a significant amount of glitter floating in with the wind. Because of that, I decided to move down to the panhandle of the lake. There, I caught two tiny DFGs on the micetail. I did get a hit on the salmon egg/marshmallow but it didn't quite stick.

Not bad for a couple of hours time. I don't typically fish Shadow Cliffs that often because it's always a bit crowded for my taste, but maybe I'll start having to visit more given my success today...
