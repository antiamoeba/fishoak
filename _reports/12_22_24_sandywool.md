I saw online that there was a trout plant this week at Sandy Wool Lake, so I decided to make the drive out this morning. Unfortunately seems like the website was incorrect and the last stock was December 6. Nevertheless, I fished around the lake a bit, and eventually I managed a nice trout off the side of the big hill on a <a href="https://amzn.to/4gRkgPn">chartreuse and orange micetail</a>. Other than that, seems like nobody else caught any fish except a couple of the egrets. They nabbed a couple tiny trout when I was there.

The water is really muddy right now. Hopefully with a little bit less rain things will clear up by the next plant.
