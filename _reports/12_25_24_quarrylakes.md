Did a Quarry Lakes Christmas today with my family --- they don't fish, but they wanted to accompany me today! The water was a lot clearer than I expected, given all the recent rain. I ended up catching 1 Lassen and 5 DFGs, all on <a href="https://amzn.to/4gRkgPn">chartreuse and orange micetails</a>. Threw back 1 of the DFGs, which was pretty promptly eaten by a waiting pelican. The DFGs are fun, but hope the local park district starts planting some of the bigger trout again.

I tried a couple spots on the backside and the peninsula, but all the fish ended up being caught in one spot. As always at Quarry, gotta keep moving until you find the trout, and then you'll have pretty quick action.
