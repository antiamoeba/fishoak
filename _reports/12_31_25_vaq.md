Happy New Year everybody! We saw that the local management had stocked trout on the 30th, so we decided to make the drive over to do a bit of exploring! We started our day at the South Cove, throwing <a href="https://amzn.to/4gRkgPn">micetails</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3DDrtUF">Kastmasters</a>. However, it was very crowded and the fishing was slow --- over the 2 hrs we were there, we didn't see anyone catch a single trout. As a result, we decided to head up into Cowboy Cove, and hopefully try to track down some holdover trout that might be a little less lockjawed. There was a bit more life here --- we saw an eagle catch a trout, a couple bass surfacing, and a few fishermen catching stripers, but the fishing was similarly slow.

A skunk of a day, but Vaqueros is always pretty enough to make it worth it.
