Before the rain storms really hit, I decided to take the opportunity to do some light fishing at Shadow Cliffs. I mainly fished the Stanley Blvd shoreline this time, as I wasn't in the mood to battle the crowds. Fishing in general was pretty slow --- I was there for about 5 hours, and caught only a small Lassen on a <a href="https://amzn.to/3MblFGg">Gulp bubblegum trout worm</a> right before sunset.

Besides that, I did get a solid bite on a marshmallow + <a href="https://amzn.to/48IgXbQ">salmon egg</a> that set off my fishing bells. Unfortunately, the culprit left for greener pastures by the time I turned around. Hopefully the fishing picks up at some of these EBRPD lakes, as paying $5 every time for a fishing permit is not particularly attractive when fishing is slow like this...
