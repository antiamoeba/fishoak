I was originally planning on heading to Carmel this morning, but today ended up being a free fishing day at the East Bay Regional Park District! That means no extra $5 fishing permit required, so I decided to take the opportunity to do a bit of late afternoon/evening fishing at Quarry Lakes. I've been meaning to do a bit more catfishing recently, so this time I primarily focused on the main lake (Horseshoe).

Unfortunately not a huge amount of action today. I fished a [Z-Man Slim SwimZ](https://amzn.to/4mN1Qlz) on a splitshot rig for a while trying to nab any bigger bass, but no luck. There were some pretty big swarms of small baby bass though that were practically jumping out of the water as sunset hit --- pretty easy to land with a small piece of worm, but not the most satisfying catch. I also had a catfish rod casted out with frozen shrimp for a couple hours, but no action either. These days I typically fish the back side of the lake, but I haven't had too much luck with the catfish there. I may need to try the closer half one of these days...
