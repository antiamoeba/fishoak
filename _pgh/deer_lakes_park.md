# Fishing Deer Lakes Park

About 30 minutes from Pittsburgh proper, Deer Lakes Park is an excellent place to escape for a relaxing fishing experience. All three lakes are regularly stocked with trout when in-season --- look for "Lower Deer Lake", "Middle Deer Lake" and "West Deer Lake" on the <a href="https://fbweb.pa.gov/TroutStocking" target="_blank">PFBC website</a> (not sure why the last lake is named differently).

## About the Lakes

In general, the lakes here are rather shallow affairs, and can get absolutely overgrown with weeds. What that means for fishing is that panfish are absolutely everywhere in these lakes. A piece of worm will easily net you a solid bluegill, while a minnow or small jig can entice a crappie or two. There are also a sprinkling of small bass and catfish, but I don't see too many people fish for them.

For the stocked trout, I've found that picking a good spot is really important here --- you can be standing right next to someone who catches their limit in half an hour, while you have nothing to show. In general, fishing the few deeper spots are key to landing trout. Good examples are the middle of Lower Deer Lake between the pavilions, next to the big tule stand on Middle Deer Lake, and the submerged creek channel on West Deer Lake. Classic baits like <a href="https://amzn.to/3thy8dM">Powerbait</a>, worms or minnows will do the job. Fish also sometimes school up by the aerators on Lower and Middle Deer Lakes; fishing a small <a href="https://amzn.to/3pqIyHL" target="_blank">minijig</a> next to them can be extremely effective, as it doesn't seem like the local trout have wisened up yet like their West Coast cousins.

I've never skunked at these lakes. Hope that doesn't change...

## Notes

Lower and Middle Deer Lakes are very developed, encircled by paved trails, concrete platforms and many benches. Can be a good place to intro somebody to fishing. In contrast, West Deer Lake feels a lot more wild --- the trail is basically mud, and there can be a lot of fallen branches and leaves in the water. So pick your lake wisely &#128512;
