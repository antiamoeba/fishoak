In this website, I aim to share some of my favorite fishing spots around the Bay Area in both freshwater and saltwater. Fishing is a great way to explore the bay, hang out with friends, and get more in touch with yourself. By giving tips and tricks for our local waterways, I hope to inspire you to get out on the water. - the creator
